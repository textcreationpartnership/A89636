            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Infinite Eternal Being, the onely True and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving GOD (who formed thee in thy Mothers womb, and breathed into thee the breath of life) Lo he is near thee, his piercing Witneſs is within thee, his All-ſeeing Eye beholds thee, he ſearches thy heart, and tries thy reins, the depths of thy Counſels are diſcovered to him; O King! Fear and dread before him. The Lord God Omnipotent, who ruleth in the Kingdoms of men, and diſpoſeth of them as he pleaſeth, hath exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee with various viciſſitudes, and ſuffered thee to be a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; he hath led thee through many ſtraits, that in thy proſperity thou ſhouldſt remember him, and bow unto him: he hath caſt thee down, and he hath raiſed thee up, and now wonderfully ſet thee upon thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Throne, even to the amazement of the people; give him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all. Now thou art chief Ruler of a numerous Nation, a wiſe and knowing people are thy Subjects, O that <hi>Solomon's</hi> requeſt unto his God were thine, that thou mightſt rightly go in and out before this people. Then ſhould divine Wiſdom be thy Diadem, and thou ſhouldſt be a bleſſing to the people.</p>
               <p>And now that the Lord hath dealt thus bountifully with thee, Come let us Reaſon together, and expoſtulate a little what may be for thy good, and what the God of thy life requireth of thee: For know this, O King, that in thy Life and Government conſiſts thy preſent, future and eternal happineſs. I have ſeen, I have ſeen the place thou ſtands on to be ſlippery ground, and the need thou haſt of Divine ſupportment; for what thy own infirmities, and the iniquities of the people thou lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to (whoſe delight is not in the Law of the living God) thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition certainly is very ſad, and to be lamented by all that love thee. Was it the mind of the Lord in this laſt overturning and change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment onely to advance an Outward Monarchy, or an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? to re-edifie the Towers of <hi>Babel?</hi> to beautifie an adulterated Harlot, and renounce his Spouſe? to crown <hi>Babylon</hi> and her Merchants, and leave <hi>Sion</hi> and her children in the duſt? Or hath the Lord any pleaſure in the fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt?</hi> or can he have fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs? or will he lend his ear to the yelling noiſe of the wicked? Art thou altogether ignorant of the wonderful things which the Lord will do? Can he forſake his <hi>Sion?</hi> can he delight himſelf in <hi>Babylon?</hi> or thinkeſt thou he hath forgotten to be gracious to his people? He cannot forget his Own, his Seed is ſure to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by him, and the Kings of the earth muſt bow before him.</p>
               <p>There is a people that are near unto thee, and enjoy a liberal ſhare of thy natural affections; but, O King! their hearts are not right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, nor are ſome of them faithful in their love to thee. By their fruits thou ſhalt know them, if they creep into places of honour, profit, and preferment to themſelves, if they hunt after the Earth, and mind earthly things, they are of <hi>Eſau's</hi> generation. Beware of them, for they will ſooner enrich themſelves in thy Ruine, then either ſerve thee or their generation faithfully. There are others alſo, who with their tongues extol thee, but the guile of their hearts, and the burning heat in their breaſts diſhonour thee; Rancour and malice remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, and they take conuſel together for the blood of the innocent. Theſe men know not how to forgive an enemy: O King! be wiſe, and let not ſuch have too much influence upon thee. Another ſort there is that are of <hi>Haman's</hi> nature; couldſt thou give every individual of them to the half of thy Kingdom, yet while <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſits in the gate, and bows not to that exalted ſpirit, all would not avail them; <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Amaleck</hi> will joyn hand in hand to incenſe the King againſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and if poſſible, through their miſ-reports and importunity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Decree from <hi>Caeſar</hi> for the Baniſhment or Deſtruction of that People. Theſe men with their <hi>Dulce Venenum</hi> will indanger thee; and if thou giveſt thy power unto them, will unavoidably be thy Ruine; <hi>Therefore hear O King! and deſpiſe not good counſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give not the choiſeſt Jewel in thy Crown to ſuch unworthy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, but ſtay thy mind upon the Royal Law written in thy Heart <note place="bottom">* Obſequium amicos, Veritas odium parit.</note>
with the finger of the living God; let thy delight be to read and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on that golden Book day and night. Make that invaluable Jewel of my God placed in thy ſoul, the Line or Rule of thy life, and that will make thy Life happy, and thy Reign glorious. Tis the ſpring of Divine Wiſdom; Drink thy fill, O King, at that celeſtial Fountain; drink, I ſay, abundantly thereat, thou canſt never draw it dry. O that thy heart were refreſhed with the ſtreams of eternal life that flows from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now the remaining part of my meſſage to thee, is that which the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God expecteth from thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dwell, O King, in that noble Principle which leads to Mercy and Moderation. Lean no longer upon the Reeds of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> nor ttuſt no more to the inchantments of her Magicians; but let them know thou dwel'ſt in that wiſdom which is above them, and haſt now learn'd to forgive an Enemy: O King I counſel thee, be drawn no further into Blood; but make them <hi>Quondams</hi> I require thee, that ſhall wilfully perſiſt to miniſter any Woolviſh Counſel to thee; Drink no more of their bitter Waters. Be cloathed with the Royal Robe of Clemency, and count it thy honor to be affectionately kind to the Kingdom, to paſs by injuries, and forgive wrongs; For to ſhew mercy is better than to be dyed in blood, and would ſooner inthrone thee in the affections of the people, than outward force or violence; and count them not thy friends that counſels thee to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And as for Religion, This the righteous God requireth of thee: Live in that which is pure and undefiled, and keep within thy Sphere: Force not any to an outward Form; for Conſcience is Chriſts Throne, and if thou ſeek'ſt to Lord it there, or ſuffer others ſo to do, thou art an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, and Sions King will plead his Controverſie with thee, and make War againſt thee, and be to hard ſor thee. Therefore O King, let the Seed of God go free, and be no longer oppreſſed by the Egyptian Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters: Take not that Authority upon thee, which Chriſt the Son of God never gave unto thee, nor no power; But let every man worſhip his God as he is perſwaded in his conſcience; for what is not of faith is ſin, and faith is the gift of God. Wouldſt thou, O King, be forced to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny form againſt thy Conſcience? Surely not. Then do not thou offer to uſe force againſt the People, but let equal liberty herein be given to all people, I require it of thee in the Name of the Living God, as their proper right and priviledge, and as thou expects his bleſſing in this world, and in the world to come. And roll away the ſtone of reproach from this Engliſh Nation, which long hath been a profeſſing People; I ſay remove and take away all force and compulſion about Religion, and down with Tythes and all forced maintenance of any Miniſtry. Ah how many of the dear children of God are now in Bonds, and have been long in ſeveral Goals of this Nation, and ſome have there ended their daies for conſcience ſake, becauſe they cannot ſatisfie a greedy, devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Antichriſtian Miniſtry. Shall not, and hath not the righteous God viſited for theſe things. O let the innocent ſufferings of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Seed come before thee, let the cry of the oppreſſed pierce through thee, and enter into thy bowels, that thy heart may be filled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards them, and the Priſon-doors by thee may be opened for them, and for all that ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake: This is a work would make thee glorious, and happy were <hi>Englands</hi> King, would he thus favour Gods people. But if thou ſtill wilt ſtop thy ears to good counſel, and give away thy power to the Prelates who will perſecute; and if thou wilt ſtrengthen the hands of the Uncircumciſed Philiſtines; if thou wilt make covenant with Death, and let thy little fingers prove heavier than the Ioins of thy Predeceſſors, and ſeek to baniſh Truth out of thy Coaſts, and utterly ſubvert the Royal Seed;</p>
               <p>Then know this, O King; The righteous God who ſet thee upon the Throne, will pluck thee down; He will overthrow on the right hand, and on the left, until <hi>Sions</hi> enemies be confounded. He wil take the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from thee; He will overturn thy Mountain, and lay thine honor in the Duſt, and work deliverance for his people in a way which yet thou ſeeſt not, and then ſhalt thou know the words of truth are ſpoken by me,</p>

               <p>NEver had King of <hi>England</hi> more precious Warnings from the life of God, than God hath given unto Thee: Oh King! what ſhall I ſay unto Thee? Wilt thou ſtill caſt all his councels behind Thee? O that Thou wouldſt anſwer his Love unto Thee, by thy Life and Government, in Mercy, Truth, and Righteouſneſs; Let not Truth be deſpiſed by Thee, becauſe by the world 'tis miſ-reported to Thee; The world loves its own. 'Tis onely TRUTH that is truly honourable; and Virtue is the <note place="margin">Virtus eſt vera Nobilitas.</note> true Nobility. Truth is invincible; the more men ſeek to ſuppreſs it, the more it grows; the Gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt it; nor can all the ſtrength of <hi>Egypt</hi> daunt or overcome it. Truth is ſtronger than All; and that is a Meaſure of it which in thy Conſcience bears its Teſtimony againſt all Iniquity. All that ſtrive againſt it (the Truth) ſhall be broken by it. Therefore O King, keep friendſhip with it, and conſent Thou not to any unrighteous Decree againſt it; Nor ſay not within thy ſelf, This Cover ſhall excuſe Me, My Peers, My Prelates, or my Parliament ſo counſel'd and perſwaded Me; for the guilt will ſtick upon Thee; but in time be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd, and let the Ruines of others who are gone before Thee, who once in ſtrength were equal with Thee, be a Warning to thee; for of a truth Our God is no reſpecter of perſons; If thou doeſt well, ſhalt Thou not be accepted? But if thou wilt not own Gods light in thy Conſcience, and by it be guided, nor remove Oppreſſion and oppreſſing Laws, nor ſet up Judges as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, men fearing God, and hating Covetouſneſs, but wilt make war againſt the Lamb, and ſuffer thy ſelf to be enſnared and ſeduced by the deceitful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; then know aſſuredly, 'Tis in vain for Thee to ſtrive againſt Thy Maker, God will be juſtified when he pleads his Controverſie with Thee in the day of thy Calamity, which will aſſuredly come upon Thee, if in the Light Thou believeſt not. Wherefore O King be wiſe, and remember Thou art once more warned.</p>
